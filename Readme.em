Bot Developer interview.

1. Create a java application and make sure to use maven, add the JDA dependency to the application
2. Make small antispam system - I want you then to create another class and register it as a listener and listen to whenever a new message is received. If the user has sent more than 5 messages in the last 2 seconds, I want you to ban him, if it's less than 5, increment by one to the cache. I want the cache to expire every 3 seconds though.
3. Listen to new users login - I want you to listen to another event, whenever a new member joins the server, I want you to create a small embed, you're free to configure it as much as you want, then send the embed to his private messages, make sure to handle the error if his dms aren't open, send to general chat instead.
4. Create a slash command - I want you to make sure that it checks for the member and confirms he has Core Staff role, else deny permission. If he does, I want you to get the users of all the EN guild and check one by.
